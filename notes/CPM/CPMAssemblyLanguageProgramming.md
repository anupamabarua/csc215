## Preface
- Computer programs written in assembly launage can be found in alot of places
- Not easy to learn
- Have to study the internal sturcture of the computer
- New set of instruction for each computer
- assembly programmer will be working in a familiar environment.
## Introduction
- "cr" symbol represents the pressing the RETURN key
- Mnemonics "JMP" for jump it makes assembly makes language source code easier to read
-  this source program is keyed into a disk file using CP/
M's ED.COM and is assembled by CP/M's ASM.COM, it will
produce the same machine language code that you typed in manually using DDT.
- Assembly language programming is very available of higher level languages for microcomputers has relegated assembly programming to those application areas where it is
indispensable: intimate interfacing with hardware, and for sizeand time-critical operations
- useful for writing programs for dedicated controllers where program size needs to be minimized to reduce cost
- Required materials:
-  manual set that accompanied the CP/M operating system
- One complete copy of the CP/M system disk and a nice
fresh clean empty disk should be dedicated to your exercises and
experiments.
- Copy of "8080/8085 Assembly Language Programming Manual," publication number 98-940
