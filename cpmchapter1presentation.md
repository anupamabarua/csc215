# Other peripherals
- Some other things that are needed are:
- Floppy Disks: Used to exchange programs and data but are not compatable with all sources of data
- Paper tape reader/paper tape punch: these devices are slow and outdated but cpm still uses their names - default names for I/O devices
- Modem:  the most universally compatible method of exchaning data - can comunitcate with other computers over a phone line bu using ASCII
- Other devices can look like a modem but they have a specific interface which makes them only work on a single computer

# A simple computer system
- For the CPM to work the minimunm 16K RAM is required, so is some type of hard copy device 
- You can learn this language by writing, editing, assembling, and debugging programs
